Files
=====

The archive has 3 subdirectories:
src/ contains the code of the plugin in counting.ml and
  a support file for building the plugin.

theories/ contains Counting.v used to load the plugin on
  the Coq side.

tests/ just demonstrates a use of the plugin

Installation
============

First, you should have coqc, ocamlc and make in your path.
Then simply do:

# coq_makefile -f make > Makefile

To generate a makefile from the description in Make, then [make].
This will consecutively build the plugin, the supporting
theories and the test file.

You can then either install the plugin with

# sudo ./install.sh

or leave it in its current directory and to be able to import it
from anywhere in Coq, simply add the following to ~/.coqrc:

Add Rec LoadPath "path_to_counting/theories" as Counting.
Add ML Path "path_to_counting/src".
